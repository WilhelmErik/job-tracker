🗺️ Project Roadmap: Job Tracker
🚧 Phase 1: Core Functionality (Current Focus)
• Kanban Board UI: Create columns (Applied, Interviewing, Rejected, Offer).

• Drag & Drop: Implement ability to move job cards between columns.

• State Management: Connect Kanban actions to Zustand store.

🎨 Phase 2: UX & Polish (Next Up)
• Mobile Responsiveness: Ensure columns stack or scroll well on phones.

• Data Persistence: Save data to local storage (or database) so it doesn't vanish on refresh.

• Job Card Details: Expand card to show notes, salary, and links.

🚀 Phase 3: "Engineer" Level Features (Future)
• Backend Integration: Move from dummy data to a real Node/Express backend.

• AI Integration (Gemini API):

  • Feature: "Smart Paste" (Extract job details from raw text).

  • Feature: "Vibe Check" (Compare resume vs. job description).

• Analytics: Simple chart showing applications per week.
